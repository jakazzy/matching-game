# Memory card Game

## Introduction

This game is a great card game that helps to improve memory. You can play it with a pack of cards, or with picture of cards.

It is a memory-based game since for every card turned, players must need to remember its position and match it with another turned card.

The objective is to collect the most pairs of cards.
The cards get shuffled on page load, facing down, in rows.

On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and wins a score if the cards match (for instance, two Vuejs pictures)
If they successfully match a pair they win a score, and the player gets another turn.
When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position).
The trick is to remember which cards are where.
